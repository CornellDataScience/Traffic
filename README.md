# Traffic

Hello! Traffic is currently a couple weeks into implementation. We are working on a simulation, the code for which will hopefully be pushed this weekend.
What we have right now is largely infrastructure code, setting up the networks. The actual simulation is not pushed yet as it is
not quite done, but this should be the infrastructure we need to accomplish our goals.

P.S. Apologize for the messy, poorly organized code. We have been very busy lately.
